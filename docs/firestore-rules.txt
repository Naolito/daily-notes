# Firestore Security Rules

Go to Firebase Console > Firestore Database > Rules and paste these rules:

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow authenticated users to read/write their own data
    match /users/{userId}/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // For development/testing - remove in production
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

These rules ensure:
- Users can only access their own data
- Anonymous users can still read/write (they have auth.uid)
- No unauthenticated access is allowed

Click "Publish" after pasting the rules.
